# Pneumonia Classifier App

Pneumonia-Classifier-App is an image classification project that detects signs of pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow. The application provides a simple web interface for users to upload X-ray images and receive predictions about the presence of pneumonia, powered by Streamlit for rapid deployment and ease of use.

## Problem Statement

Early and accurate detection of pneumonia is critical for effective treatment and patient outcomes. However, manual diagnosis from chest X-ray images can be time-consuming and prone to human error. This project aims to automate the process of pneumonia detection by leveraging deep learning techniques to analyze X-ray images, providing reliable predictions that assist healthcare professionals in clinical decision-making.

## Quick glance at the results

![Demo](assets/pneumonia_app.gif)

- Test Accuracy: 87.02%

- Model evaluated on held-out test X-ray images.

## Limitation and what can be improved

- Limitations:

  - The model‚Äôs accuracy is dependent on the quality and size of the training data; real-world performance may vary if the input images differ from the training samples.

  - The application currently focuses only on binary classification (pneumonia vs. normal), without distinguishing between different types or severities of pneumonia.

  - It does not provide localization or highlighting of pneumonia regions within images.

  - The app is intended for educational and research purposes‚Äînot for clinical or diagnostic use without further validation.

- Possible Improvements:

  - Expand the dataset with more diverse and higher-quality images to improve model robustness.

  - Incorporate multi-class classification to distinguish between different pneumonia types.

  - Add visualization features such as heatmaps or bounding boxes to indicate affected lung areas.

  - Integrate explainable AI techniques for more transparent predictions.

  - Deploy the model with cloud-based APIs for scalability and remote access.

## Lessons Learned and Recommendations

- Lessons Learned:

  - Building deep learning models for medical imaging requires careful data preprocessing, class balancing, and validation to ensure trustworthy results.

  - Deployment with Streamlit enables rapid prototyping and user-friendly interfaces, making it easier to demonstrate and test models outside of local environments.

- Model generalizing is crucial‚Äîtraining and testing on diverse datasets helps improve reliability and real-world effectiveness.

- Recommendations:

  - Continuously validate the model on new, real-world datasets to monitor and improve performance.

  - Collaborate with medical professionals to align the application with clinical workflows and requirements.

  - Consider implementing additional checks and expandability features for greater transparency and trust in predictions.

  - For future projects, explore integrating advanced architectures (such as transfer learning and attention mechanisms) and addressing data annotation quality to further enhance outcomes.
